Description of Waze protocol, as little as I needed to gather to show alerts in my CarPC...

All requests are sent via HTTP, to http://rt.waze.com/rtserver/*

Everything begins with a login request:

POST request to http://rt.waze.com/rtserver/login
Data format is not the usual form-urlencoded, but it's just sent like this:
Login,1,username,password,4,5,6,7,8,9

I haven't looked deeply at other parameters except username and password. Waze developers will probably be cursing at me for polluting their DB's with wrong information- but hey, they are the one's not documenting their "open source" app.

This request returns something along these lines:

RC,200,OK
LoginSuccessful,350366185,PRejpawErfntCQLr

We're interested in last two data items- login id, and server cookie.
